Okay, here's the English translation of the provided text, maintaining the original context and structure:

1. General Architecture Overview

The error registration service will consist of the following main components:

Client SDK: A lightweight library integrated into client applications (web, mobile, server-side Node.js) for automatic or manual collection and sending of error information.
API Backend: Receives error data from the SDK, validates, processes, enriches it, and stores it in the database. It also provides data for the web panel.
Database: Storage for error logs, project metadata, and user data.
Management Web Panel (Dashboard): An interface for users (developers, managers) to view, search, filter, analyze errors, and configure notifications.
Notification System: Sends notifications (e.g., email) about critical errors in real-time.
DevOps Infrastructure: Ensures the deployment, scaling, monitoring, and maintenance of the service.
Technology Stack:

Client SDK: TypeScript, Rollup/Webpack
TypeScript: For type safety, reliability, and improved Developer Experience (DX).
Rollup/Webpack: For creating optimized, lightweight bundles for different environments (browser, Node.js). Allows for tree-shaking.
API Backend: Node.js, NestJS
Node.js: High performance for I/O operations, unified language stack with the frontend and SDK.
NestJS: A TypeScript-based framework providing structure (modules, controllers, services), Dependency Injection (DI), microservices support, and queue integration, which simplifies development and maintenance.
Database (Errors): Elasticsearch
Optimized for full-text search, aggregation, and analysis of large volumes of text data (logs). Horizontally scalable. Ideal for queries like "find similar errors" or "error trends."
Database (Metadata): PostgreSQL
A reliable relational database for storing structured data: users, projects, notification settings, retention policies. Supports ACID, complex queries, and relationships.
Web Panel (React): React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Ant Design/MUI
React: High performance, component-based approach, large ecosystem.
TypeScript: Type safety.
Redux Toolkit: Efficient state management.
Ant Design/MUI: Ready-to-use UI components for rapid development of a quality interface.
Message Queue: RabbitMQ (or Apache Kafka)
RabbitMQ: For asynchronous error processing. Decouples the API from processing services, increasing reliability and throughput. Allows the API to respond quickly to the client. Kafka can be considered for very high loads and stream processing.
Notification Service: Node.js, Nodemailer, SendGrid/AWS SES
Node.js: Stack consistency.
Nodemailer: Library for sending emails.
SendGrid/AWS SES: Reliable email delivery services that reduce the risk of emails going to spam.
DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana
Docker: Containerization for environment consistency.
Kubernetes (K8s): Orchestration for scaling and fault tolerance.
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automating and managing infrastructure.
GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI): CI/CD.
Prometheus/Grafana: Monitoring and visualization of metrics.
Key Architectural Decisions

Real-time Processing and Asynchronicity:

Error Ingestion: The API Backend endpoint (/ingest) quickly receives data from the SDK, performs minimal validation (e.g., presence of the project API key), and sends a message with error details to the message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka). This allows the API to respond to the SDK instantly (e.g., 202 Accepted).
Error Processing: A separate worker service (or group of workers) subscribes to the queue. It retrieves messages, performs full validation, data enrichment (e.g., adding geolocation by IP, parsing user-agent), groups similar errors, and saves them to Elasticsearch and, if necessary, updates metadata in PostgreSQL.
Notifications: If an error is identified as critical (based on rules configured in the Web Panel), the worker also sends an event to another queue or directly calls the Notification Service, which formats and sends an email.
Log Retention Policies:

Configuration: Policies will be configured at the project level via the Web Panel (e.g., store data for 30 days, 90 days, 1 year).
Implementation:
Elasticsearch: Use Elasticsearch Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) for automatic index management. For example, creating new indices daily. Old indices can be moved to "warm" (less performant but cheaper nodes), then "cold" (rarely accessed, even cheaper), and eventually deleted.
Alternative/Supplement: For long-term archiving, data can be exported from Elasticsearch to cheaper storage (e.g., AWS S3 Glacier) before deletion from Elasticsearch.
Purging: Regular tasks (cron jobs or via K8s CronJob) to purge data according to policies.
API Rate Limiting:

Purpose: Protection against abuse, API-level DDoS attacks, and ensuring fair resource usage.
Implementation:
At the API Gateway level (if used, e.g., AWS API Gateway, Nginx).
At the application level (Node.js/NestJS) using libraries like express-rate-limit or a custom implementation based on Redis (for storing request counters).
Limits can be applied by IP address or project API key.
Different limits for different endpoints (e.g., higher limits for /ingest, lower for analytical queries from the Web Panel).
Security:

SDK - API:
Each project receives a unique API key (Project Token/DSN). The SDK sends this key with every request.
All traffic via HTTPS/TLS.
API Backend:
Validation of API keys.
Protection against OWASP Top 10 (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.) through input validation, use of ORM/ODM, and proper output encoding.
User authentication for the Web Panel via JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2/OIDC.
Authorization (RBAC – Role-Based Access Control) for accessing data of different projects.
Databases:
Database access restricted from private networks/IPs.
Strong passwords, regular rotation.
Data encryption "at rest" and "in transit."
Web Panel:
HTTPS.
Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and other security HTTP headers.
CSRF protection.
Secrets: Storage of API keys, database passwords, JWT secrets in secure vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets).
DevOps Processes:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform for describing and managing all infrastructure (networks, databases, K8s clusters, load balancers).
CI/CD:
GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) for automation.
CI (Continuous Integration): For every push/merge request: linting, unit tests, integration tests, code security scanning (e.g., SonarQube), Docker image building.
CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment): Automatic deployment to a staging environment after successful CI. Manual or automatic (after additional E2E tests and approval) deployment to production. Use of Blue/Green or Canary deployment strategies to minimize risks.
Monitoring and Alerting (for the service itself):
Prometheus: Collection of metrics (CPU, RAM, network, number of errors in queue, API response time, etc.) from all system components.
Grafana: Visualization of metrics from Prometheus on dashboards.
Alertmanager (part of Prometheus): Configuration of alerts for the development team about service operational issues (e.g., high load, database unavailability).
Service Logging: Centralized collection of application logs (API, workers) in Elasticsearch (a separate cluster or indices) or another logging system (e.g., Loki).
Scalability:

Horizontal: Running multiple instances of the API Backend, processing workers, and notification service using Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) based on metrics (CPU, memory, queue length).
Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL: Have their own scaling mechanisms (clustering, replication).
As a developer, I would ask the following questions to better understand the requirements and expectations:

A. Volume and Load:
What is the expected average and peak load on the service (number of errors per second/minute/hour)?
How many client applications (projects) are planned to be supported initially and in the future (e.g., in a year)?
What is the average data size of a single error (stack trace, metadata)?
What is the expected number of concurrent users of the Web Panel?
B. Functional Requirements and Priorities: 5. Is there a requirement to support specific SDKs for certain platforms (e.g., iOS, Android, Python, Java) besides JavaScript? If so, what are the priorities? 6. What types of notifications, other than email, might be needed in the future (SMS, Slack, Webhooks)? 7. What specific analytical tools or visualizations are critically important for the Web Panel in the first stage (MVP)? (E.g., graph of error counts over time, top 5 errors, errors by application version, etc.). 8. Is there a need for users to define their own rules for grouping errors? 9. Is integration with existing issue tracking systems (Jira, Trello) required for creating tickets from errors? 10. Is there a requirement for "sourcemaps" for deobfuscating minified JavaScript code?
C. Security and Compliance: 11. Are there specific data security requirements or compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)? 12. Where should the data be stored (geographical restrictions)? 13. Will Personally Identifiable Information (PII) be sent in error logs? If so, what are the policies for its processing and masking?
D. Operational Requirements and Infrastructure: 14. Are there preferences for a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) or a need for on-premise deployment? 15. What are the expectations regarding the SLA (Service Level Agreement) – service availability, response time to critical errors? 16. Are there budget constraints that should be considered when choosing technologies and infrastructure?
E. User Experience and Business Goals: 17. Who is the target audience for the Web Panel (developers, QA, managers)? What are their main tasks? 18. What are the key success metrics for this platform? 19. Are there any existing solutions that are liked or disliked, and why?
These questions will help to form a more precise understanding of the project and ensure that the development aligns with the client's expectations.
